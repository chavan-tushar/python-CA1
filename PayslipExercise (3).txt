Exercise 2:
Also output the weekly average gross pay for all workers, for each week where there are payslips issued, and the six-week rolling average gross pay for each employee with over six weeks' pay records, for their last six weeks.
 
Regular hours cannot exceed hours worked or standard hours.
Overtime is time worked exceeding standard hours.
Pay taxed at standardrate cannot exceed gross pay or standard band.
Pay in excess of standardband is subject to the higher rate.
The tax credit reduces the tax payable.
